<p class="dropcap">Few poets singing in dialect become world famous.
This is true for the simple reason that a dialect poet
is likely to be local&mdash;to write of local things&mdash;to
avoid the universal. But Robert Burns&mdash;“poor
Burns,” as we think of him&mdash;was the exception. Who does
not know “Auld Lang Syne” and all that it means? Or who
has not said to himself in his own way,
“A man’s a man for a’ that?”</p>

<p>Robert Burns could not help but be a
poet of the people&mdash;the “peasant poet.”
He was born close to the soil of Scotland.
On January 25, 1759, he opened his eyes
in a small cottage about two miles from
Ayr, in Scotland. His father was only a
small farmer, and Robert got very little
education, but lots of hard work.</p>

<p>However, he managed to learn to read,
and used to carry his books into the fields
with him to snatch a few moments’ reading
during the day. At meal times he sat with
a spoon in one hand and a book in the
other. He liked best the ballads of Scotland&mdash;the
old songs of the minstrels.</p>

<p>But in 1781 he went to Irvine to learn
the trade of a flax-dresser. And it was
here that he indulged two habits that
clung to him all the rest of his life&mdash;drinking
and falling in love. For the poet was
a boon companion at a feast and a great
heartbreaker&mdash;but his own heart was
broken also many times.</p>

<p>His fortunes fell very low in 1786, and
he intended to sail for the West Indies,
there to try to better them. But his first
volume of poetry proved to be such a great
success that he did not go. His poems
took the people by storm. Everyone read
them. He was invited to Edinburgh,
where he became the lion of the hour.</p>

<p>But all this did not bring him in much
money. Finally, in 1789 he got a position
as excise officer. But as the years went
on, and he grew wilder and wilder in his
dissipations, friends drew away from him.
His only companions were those of the
lowest classes.</p>

<p>At last, on July 4, 1796, he knew that he
was dying. He wrote on the twelfth to his
cousin for a loan of fifty dollars, to save
him from passing his last days in jail. He
died on the twenty-first of July, 1796.</p>

<p>The Burns Cottage, near Ayr is reverently
preserved as a memorial to the poet.
Here is the little room where he was born,
and here are to be found many mementos
associated with his life. This cot, built of
clay by Burns’ father, is a shrine for those
who love the memory of the “peasant poet.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">A fierce looking man who had lost his way stood
on a beach of snow-white pebbles near a beautiful
little glassy lake and blew a loud blast on the bugle
which he held in his left hand. And almost immediately
he dodged into a nearby thicket of bushes and stood
there peering forth at a little skiff that came gliding toward
the shore from underneath a gnarled oak
tree overhanging the water. The only occupant
of the boat was a beautiful young
girl, who, after guiding it to a safe landing
on the silvery strand, stepped gracefully
out on the pebbles.</p>

<p>This was James Fitzjames’ first sight
of Ellen, the heroine of Sir Walter Scott’s
poem, “The Lady of the Lake,” which has
immortalized for all time Loch Katrine in
the Trossachs, Scotland. There in the
lake sleeps Ellens Isle, the pretty little
island on which the girl lived&mdash;and last
secret fastness of her fierce clan.</p>

<p>In the poem Fitzjames has become separated
from his companions, and his bugle
call is to summon them to his side from the
hunt on which they are engaged. But
before they come Fitzjames makes the
acquaintance of the girl and goes to Ellens
Isle with her&mdash;and that’s the beginning
of the romance that has made Scott’s
poem famous.</p>

<p>All the country round about Loch
Katrine has been made famous by Scott.
Almost every spot has been the scene of
one or more incidents in his novels. High
above Callander rise Uamh Var, where the
stag was started at the beginning of “The
Lady of the Lake,” and Ben Crackie, with
the wild Bracklin Fall, within the roar of
whose waters the seer of Clan Alpine
wrapped himself in the white bull’s hide
to dream his dream. Northward from
Callander lies the beautiful Pass of Seny,
up which Duncraggan’s heir rushed with
the Fiery Cross, to thrust it, at the door
of the little kirk of St. Bride, into the
hands of the new-wed Norman, heir of
Armandave. And westward from Callander
lie Coilantogle Ford, where James
Fitzjames fought Roderick Dhu; Lanrick
Mead, the fierce clan’s muster-place; and
Duncraggan, scene of the Highland funeral.</p>

<p>The popularity of “The Lady of the
Lake” has brought many visitors to Loch
Katrine. This beautiful region is visited
by hundreds of tourists each year.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Among the ruins of Melrose Abbey, ivy covered and
deserted, lies buried the heart of Scotland’s greatest
king&mdash;Robert Bruce. Why is it there, so far away
from his grave at Dunfermline? Bannockburn was
the greatest achievement of Bruce’s life. This decisive battle
was fought on June 24, 1314. Robert Bruce was born in 1274,
at a time when Scotland was struggling
fiercely to throw off the yoke of England
under Edward I. Bruce grew up with the
love of freedom strongly implanted in his
heart. He was a natural leader.</p>

<p>Finally, his chance came. On March 27,
1306, he had himself crowned king of Scotland;
but he was as yet a king without a
kingdom. He gathered his supporters together
and overran Scotland until only
Berwick, Stirling, and Bothwell remained
to the English. Edward I had died, and
Edward II, a weak and unstable man, was
on the British throne.</p>

<p>But even this weakling now saw that
unless a strong blow was struck Scotland
would be lost. He assembled his army
and advanced on Bruce. And then Bruce,
by a wonderful exhibition of strategy,
rapidity of movement, and personal bravery,
so decisively defeated him that the
complete rout of the English determined
the independence of Scotland and confirmed
the title of Bruce.</p>

<p>After peace had been made the new
king of Scotland proved himself as able
a lawmaker as he was a warrior. But he
did not live many years to enjoy his triumph.
On June 7, 1329, he died of leprosy,
contracted in the hardships of earlier
life, and was buried at Dunfermline.</p>

<p>Now comes the story of the “Heart of
Bruce.” During his life he made a vow to
visit the Holy Sepulcher. But he could not
do this; so he begged Douglas to carry his
heart there after his death. But the brave
Douglas, on the way to the Holy Land
stopped off in Spain to help the Spaniards
against the Moors and was killed. However,
the box containing Bruce’s heart was
recovered by Sir William Keith, and at
last was brought back to Scotland and
found a resting place in Melrose Abbey.</p>

<p>Melrose Abbey is eight hundred years
old, and, though battered both by time
and the assaults of many hostile armies, is
still famous for its architecture. It is situated
on the River Tweed, near the little
town of Melrose.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott has immortalized this
famous old ruin forever, when in “The
Lay of the Last Minstrel” he describes the
visit to Melrose Abbey of William of
Deloraine, who had come to steal from the
hand of the dead magician, Michael Scott,
his book of magic.</p>

<p>How beautiful the abbey may have
been we can only guess; but it is still picturesque,
though the windows, once filled
with wonderful stained glass, are now bare
and desolate, and the only incense on its
ruined altar is the breath of the wild rose.</p>

<p class="dropcap">A man who at the age of fifty-five resolves to pay
off a bankruptcy debt of six hundred thousand dollars
must justly be regarded as a hero. Not many
men, weakened in health and used to all the comforts,
would attempt to do this&mdash;especially when the debt was
incurred through no fault of their own, and when the law does
not force them to pay. Yet that is what
Sir Walter Scott&mdash;the “Wizard of the
North”&mdash;did, and so fiercely did he work
at his writing&mdash;twelve, fourteen, and sixteen
hours a day&mdash;that at his death six
years later every penny of that colossal
and heartbreaking debt had been paid.</p>

<p>The story of Abbotsford, the home of
the great poet and novelist, of which he
dreamed for years, and which he planned
and built himself, is a drama, a tragedy
itself. No sooner was the great house finished
and the dream of his life complete
than the crash of tremendous ruin fell on
Scott.</p>

<p>It was on a bleak winter morning in
1826 that a friend called at Abbotsford
and found the novelist terribly agitated.</p>

<p>“My friend,” said Sir Walter to him,
“give me your hand; mine is that of a
beggar.”</p>

<p>The publishing house with which he had
been connected had failed, and Scott took
upon himself the terrible burden of satisfying
its creditors. It was an apparently
hopeless task for a writer, and one in such
a frail state of health as Scott, to accomplish.
But where others would have
yielded to Fate, he stood up to fight it,
and though the effort cost him his life he
succeeded, and may truly be called the
most heroic literary figure in the world.</p>

<p>Walter Scott was born at Edinburgh on
August 15, 1771. His father wanted him
to follow his own profession, that of a
lawyer; but the boy wished to write. He
wrote poetry at first; but according to the
story turned to prose romance when he
found that Lord Byron excelled him as a
poet. It was in 1814 that a novel&mdash;“Waverley”&mdash;by
an anonymous author, appeared.
Its popularity swept like wild
fire all over England. Book after book,
all of the same excellence, was published.
The secret of authorship was jealously
kept by Scott&mdash;for what reason many
guesses have been made&mdash;but at last his
name was definitely connected with this
great series&mdash;the “Waverley Novels.”</p>

<p>He prospered brilliantly for eleven years.
And then came the crash of ruin. Scott
put his shoulder to the wheel. His wife
died soon after the struggle began; but,
though sick at heart, he toiled on indomitably.
Success was his in the end; but
the struggle killed him.</p>

<p>It was on the twenty-first of September,
1832, that Sir Walter Scott died.</p>

<p class="dropcap">One Sunday morning in 1543 a pretty, helpless little
girl baby less than a year old was seated on a throne
in the spacious chapel of Stirling Castle in Scotland,
surrounded by fierce, mailed men. A cardinal held
a crown over her head; the tiny fingers were clasped for a
moment about a scepter; a huge, unwieldy sword was buckled
round the little waist; and a noble spoke
the words that created Mary Stuart queen
of Scotland. Forty-four years later the
stroke of a sword in the headsman’s hands
ended the life of this queen&mdash;one of the most
beautiful and tragic figures in all history.</p>

<p>Besides the coronation of Mary Queen
of Scots, Stirling Castle has seen many
historic events. This old stronghold is
situated on the Firth of Forth, some thirty-five
miles above Edinburgh. It stands on
a hill high above the town of Stirling. No
one knows exactly how long ago it was
built; but it is very, very old.</p>

<p>Away back in the time of the Romans
these invaders of Britain had a station in
the town of Stirling. Alexander II, king
of Scotland, gave the town its first charter
in 1226, and he made Stirling Castle the
royal residence. During the wars of Scottish
Independence the castle was besieged
many times. Edward I of England captured
it in 1304. For ten years after that
it was held by the English; but Robert
Bruce besieged it fiercely in 1314. Edward
II, who was king of England at that
time, was a weak ruler, and he knew that
if the Scots captured Stirling Castle they
would probably win their freedom. So he
gathered an army and marched north.
But he was so badly beaten by Bruce at
the battle of Bannockburn that the Scots
won their independence, and Bruce became
their king. On the esplanade before
Stirling Castle stands a statue of this
great man.</p>

<p>The tragic story of the execution of
Mary Stuart, who was crowned at Stirling,
is one of the most pathetic episodes
in history. Condemned on an unjust
charge, she was sentenced to death by
Elizabeth, queen of England. The final
scene in the life of the beautiful queen of
Scotland took place in Fotheringay Castle
in England. As Mary approached the
block, the melancholy sweetness of her
beauty touched every heart. Even her
executioners knelt and begged her to forgive
them for the sad duty that they were
forced to perform.</p>

<p>“I forgive you with all my heart,” sadly
replied Mary.</p>

<p>She knelt down and laid her head upon
the block amid a tense silence, broken only
by an occasional sob. A moment later the
chief executioner held up her head, exclaiming,
“So perish all the enemies of
Queen Elizabeth.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">Fingals Cave is a part of the Scotland end of the
Giants Causeway, which was supposed to have once
led from Ireland to the Isle of Staffa. They say
that Fin MacCoul, or Fingal, as he is called, built
the Giants Causeway. Fingal was an Irish giant&mdash;the champion
hero of all the Emerald Isle. He wanted to fight Bennandonner,
another giant, so he built the
great causeway from Scotland to Ireland.
It is written that Fingal won. In tradition
he is the hero of both Ireland and
Scotland.</p>

<p>Fingals Cave is the most famous of the
many natural caverns on the Isle of Staffa,
one of the western islands of Scotland.
This island is three-quarters of a mile long,
and about one-third of a mile wide. No
one lives there; but every weekday during
the summer a steamer takes tourists
over to see the famous cave.</p>

<p>There are other caverns on Staffa; but
Fingals Cave is the best known. Its columns
are of basalt, and are six sided in
shape. These columns are so regular that
it seems hardly possible that the force of
the waves alone could have formed them.
But that is the fact; although not many
years ago some one rushed into print to
say that the ancient inhabitants of Scotland
and the islands nearby had dug out
all these caverns themselves. He even
gave a lecture in New York City (charging
a dollar a seat, the proceeds to go toward
building a pedestal for the Statue of Liberty)
to give his theories to the world.
Unfortunately for him he did not know
very much about geology, and could not
prove his theories to be correct.</p>

<p>It was also stated by another theorist
that the columns of the Giants Causeway
were petrified growths of bamboo; but
this idea too had only a short life.</p>

<p>Fingals Cave was discovered in 1772 by
Sir Joseph Banks, who visited Staffa on
his expedition to Iceland. The cave is on
the southern face of the island. It is 66
feet high and at the entrance 42 feet
broad. It runs back into the land a distance
of 227 feet, and is only 2 feet wide
at the end.</p>

<p>Seals and sea birds haunt the cave, and
the murmur of the sea gave it the name
in Gaelic of “The Cave of Music.” But
when the weather is stormy the cave roars
in anger. This is due to the air within
being compressed by the waves, and then
rushing out.</p>

</div>

<p>In its contour and in its varied natural features Scotland is unique. It
seems, indeed, as if Nature had shaped the land in a spirit of coquetry
with the sea.</p>

<p>Though limited in territory, Scotland has a shore line thousands of
miles in extent. Her coast is a series of inlets, firths, and sounds, and she
has added to the irregularity of her shores by setting out innumerable
beautiful islands that rear their rocky heads in the western sea. No one
knows the full beauty of Scotland who has not visited the islands.
Their picturesque and varied attractions pronounce them the true and
natural offspring of the parent land.</p>

<p>Scotland has long been called the
land of scenery and of song. The
two are intimately associated. The
scenery of Scotland has inspired many
of her songs, and the songs have paid
tribute in return by celebrating the
beauty of the scenery in affectionate
and eloquent phrase. The songs of
Scotland breathe the life of the people
and of the nation in a way that
has won the sympathetic interest of
the world. The prevailing note in
Scottish song and literature is romance.
The very name of Scotland
is fragrant with romance. Its scenery
is rich in romantic beauty and romantic
associations, and its songs
give eloquent expression to both.</p>

<p class="caption">ROBERT BURNS</p>
</div>

<p>And so the traveler in Scotland
finds the charm of her scenery happily
voiced for him, and as he wanders
from one spot to another he can recall the lines that enhance its
beauty. It may be “The Banks and Braes o’ Bonnie Doon” or “Within
a Mile of Edinboro’ Town.” Wherever he goes he may enjoy the scenery
in companionship with the spirit of the poet who sang its praises.</p>

<p>To most of us Scotland means Wallace and Robert Bruce in heroic
chivalry, and Walter Scott and Robert Burns in romance and in song.
Most of the scenes and places that interest the traveler are associated with
one or another of these four names.</p>

<h3>THE HOME OF BURNS</h3>

<p>The name of Robert Burns has a hold upon the people of Scotland
and on those who visit there such as finds no parallel in any other country.
This makes a visit to the small town of Ayr an incident of prime
interest to the tourist. The Robert Burns Cottage is situated about two
miles from the town, and it is kept with reverent care as a memorial. The
building itself, low-roofed and humble, with its Burns mementos, is a
veritable shrine for lovers of the poet.</p>

<p>The chief feature of the quaint old house is the little, low-ceilinged
room in which Burns was born in 1759. You will be glad to linger there
awhile. The impressions of the room will remain in your memory for all
time. As you note the humble simplicity of the scene you will get close
to Burns, and you will feel the full meaning and appeal of his lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Gie me a spark of Nature’s fire!</div>
<div class="verse">That’s a’ the learning I desire.</div>
<div class="verse">Then, tho’ I drudge thro’ dub an’ mire</div>
<div class="verse indent2">At plow or cart,</div>
<div class="verse">My muse&mdash;tho’ hamely in attire&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">May touch the heart!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The whole country roundabout is full of Burns associations. A
short distance off is Auld Alloway Kirk, where Burns’ father is buried, and
where Tam o’ Shanter, overcome by the spirits that he imbibed too freely,
was assailed and pursued by spirits ghostly. A short distance beyond the
church are two bridges over the Doon, the old bridge being celebrated as the
one over which Tam o’ Shanter made his escape from the evil spirits. In
the garden near the bridges stands the formal but impressive Burns
Monument.</p>

<p class="caption">AULD BRIG O’ DOON</p>

<p class="caption"><i>The old bridge at Ayr, celebrated in Burns’ lines.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Between that humble cottage
down the road toward Ayr,
and the Greek monument in
the garden, is told the story of
a simple, sweet, singing bard,
whose lines so completely filled
the hearts of his fellowmen that
the very scenes of which he
sang have become endeared
to all humanity.</p>

<h3>THE WALTER SCOTT
COUNTRY</h3>

<p>Between Loch Achray and
Loch Katrine lies the Trossachs,
beautiful in winding
wooded roads and lake and
mountain views&mdash;and famed
chiefly for being Walter Scott’s
own land of romance. It has
often been said that one who
has read Scott’s novels needs
no guidebook in the Trossachs.
Drive through this charming
valley to Loch Katrine, a beautiful
lake nearly ten miles long. From the east end steep cliffs ascend from
the water’s edge, and there, looking through the brilliant foliage on the
bank, you can see the pretty little <i>Ellens Isle</i>, made immortal in Walter
Scott’s poem, “Lady of the Lake.” This is one of the most “pictured” spots
in Scotland. You will find it in any illustrated volume of Scott’s poems.
You will find it in color and in gravure, in large prints and on postcards,
wherever you turn. It is the very heart of the Trossachs, and one of the
most inviting spots in the British Isles&mdash;as attractive in its natural beauty
as in the romantic associations that cast their spell about it.</p>

<h3>MELROSE ABBEY</h3>

<p>Hallowed by eight hundred years of history and immortalized by
Walter Scott, Melrose Abbey stands today the most interesting, as well
as the most beautiful, ruin in Scotland. It is the drawing attraction of the
little town of Melrose, situated on the
Tweed. Enticed by the magic of Scott’s
lines, thousands visit the Abbey every
year.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“If thou wouldst view fair Melrose aright,</div>
<div class="verse">Go visit it by the pale moonlight.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So firmly have these verses stamped
themselves on the hearts of readers all
over the world that tourists feel that
their visit is not complete unless they
have seen the Abbey “by pale moonlight.”
In response to this desire the
Abbey is opened on moonlight nights
for special visits.</p>

</div>

<p>Melrose Abbey was founded by
David the First, in the twelfth century.
After being destroyed by Edward the
Second, it was rebuilt by Robert Bruce
in the fourteenth century. It was
again destroyed and rebuilt in the following
century. During the many
years of its history it suffered dreadfully
from the ravages of war. Armies
of invasion from England ruthlessly assaulted its sacred precincts and
destroyed its beautiful features. In spite of that, after being reconstructed
several times, it
holds its place as a beautiful
example of architecture and
a most picturesque ruin.</p>

<h3>THE HOME OF SCOTT</h3>

<p>About three miles from
Melrose, on the right bank of
the Tweed, stands Abbotsford,
a name most dear to
readers of the Waverley
novels. There the “Wizard
of the North,” as he was
called, wrote his way into
fame and fortune; there he
lived when his fortune was
swept away with that of his publisher; and there in his old age he
settled himself grimly to repay debts amounting to six hundred thousand
dollars&mdash;all by the work of his pen. He finished this stupendous
task in about six years. He discharged his debts honorably; but he gave
his lifeblood to the task. Scarcely had he come clear of his debts when
his pen fell from his hand, and, in the bright, sunny dining room of
Abbotsford, he dropped wearily to sleep, with the waters of his
beloved Tweed murmuring musically in his ears. He had kept faith
with his creditors; he had paid the last penny; he had secured his home
for his children&mdash;and his work was done.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Showing the location of Sir Walter Scott’s tomb.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Attended by a funeral procession more than a mile in length, including
the great that came from distant parts to do him honor, and the humble
peasant neighbors that knew and loved him, Sir Walter Scott’s body was
borne reverently to Dryburgh Abbey, and in that beautiful ruin, a most
appropriate spot, he now lies
at rest.</p>

<h3>THE CASTLES OF
SCOTLAND</h3>

<p>Two of the most impressive
and picturesque castles
of the world are in Scotland,&mdash;Stirling
Castle and Edinburgh
Castle.</p>

<p>Stirling Castle is situated
on the Firth of Forth about
thirty-five miles above Edinburgh,
and it was for years the
favorite residence of Scottish
sovereigns. It played a prominent
part in the history of
Scotland, and is intimately
associated with the name of
Robert Bruce, who recaptured
the castle from Edward the
Second of England, in the
fourteenth century, after the
battle of Bannockburn.</p>

<p>The castle, like that of
Edinburgh, is situated on a
lofty height. On the esplanade
before it stands a statue
of Robert Bruce. The view from all sides is beautiful, and commands,
on the west, a fair range of mountains, including Ben Lomond and
Ben Venue, while on the south the battlefield of Bannockburn stretches
away before the eye.</p>

<p class="caption">EDINBURGH CASTLE</p>

<p class="caption"><i>One of the most beautiful and impressive castles in Great Britain.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Edinburgh Castle, an ancient seat of Scottish kings, has a most magnificent
situation on a rocky height above the city. On three sides the
mountain on which it stands drops almost sheer. On the east it slopes
gradually off toward Holyrood.</p>

<h3>THE HOME OF MARY, QUEEN OF SCOTS</h3>

<p>There at Holyrood we find the scene of one of Scotland’s most affecting
dramas,&mdash;the tragedy of Mary, Queen of Scots. Holyrood Castle,
which was the unfortunate queen’s home for many years, is part ruin and
part in good repair and occupied. It is there that the visitor can see the
bedroom of the fair young Scottish queen, and there also the spot where
her unfortunate minstrel and counselor, Rizzio, was murdered. Holyrood
is intimately associated with the memories of Mary, Queen of Scots, and
all who have followed with interest her sad story and want to feel an impression
of her actual presence should spend a day in and about the castle.</p>

<p class="caption">HOLYROOD CASTLE</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Associated with the most dramatic years in the life of the unfortunate Mary,

</div>

<p>The modern Scottish home of British royalty is Balmoral, situated
on an estate of ten thousand acres about fifty miles from Aberdeen.
This beautiful palace was purchased by the Crown in 1852 from the Earl
of Fife for one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. It was for years the
favorite country home of Queen Victoria, and is now said to be the most
cherished residence of British royalty.</p>

<h3>THE SCOTTISH ISLES</h3>

<p>Months could be profitably spent in touring through the Isles of
Scotland, and they would be months of unalloyed delight. Two small
islands should be visited even in the course of the briefest Scottish tour,
the Island of Iona, where Saint Columba, the missionary, landed from
Ireland in 563, to begin his missionary work in Scotland, and on which are
to be found the tombs of ancient Scottish, Irish, and Norwegian kings.</p>

<p>For over a thousand years the Island of Iona was the chosen
“God’s Acre” for the great chieftains. The land was held sacred on
account of Columba, and it was regarded as the securest spot on earth for
mortal remains to rest in. Therefore the bodies of kings were taken
there even from distant points in Ireland and in Norway, and for centuries
Iona was the Mecca of religious pilgrims who went there to pray and
to pay reverent tribute to the tombs of the great.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Visited by many every year, this is the most interesting spot in Holyrood Castle.</i></p>
</div>

<h3>FINGALS CAVE</h3>

<p>Historic interest will draw you to Iona; the interest of wild nature will
attract you to Staffa. On the Isle of Staffa is Fingals Cave, one of Nature’s
curiosities, extraordinary in its formation and offering features of a
wonder-compelling kind. The island is a rounded tableland which
has been thrust up through the sea by volcanic action. It is about two
miles in circumference, and rises nearly 150 feet above the surface of the
ocean. The cave, which is crowned by a high arch of land, rises sixty
feet above the sea, and through its interior length it varies from
twenty to forty feet in width. Staffa has many caves; but the extraordinary
size and character of Fingals Cave centers the interest of all visitors
there. It is impossible in rough weather to enter the cave by boat. The
method of visiting is to land some distance away and enter by a
protected footpath. Once inside, the effect of surging, roaring waves
overarched by echoing walls of basalt is most impressive. The basaltic
columns&mdash;similar in formation to those of the Giants Causeway,
across the sea on the coast of Ireland&mdash;rear themselves in parallel
lines like a formidable palisade constructed for the support and protection
of the cave.</p>

<p class="caption">BALMORAL CASTLE</p>

<p class="caption"><i>The highland home of British royalty&mdash;Queen Victoria’s favorite summer residence. Purchased by the Crown

</div>

<p>We have visited but a few of the many places renowned for
beauty and romance in the land of the heather. We have not seen
Ben Nevis and the ruins of Inverlochy Castle; nor Swan Island in
Loch Lomond; nor yet Lochleven Castle with its thrilling tradition of
Queen Mary’s escape.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“No warden’s fire shall e’er again</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Illume Lochleven’s bosom fair;</div>
<div class="verse">No clarion shrill of armed men</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The breeze across the lake shall bear;</div>
<div class="verse">But while remains a stone of thine,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">It shall be linked to royal fame,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">For here the Rose of Stuart’s line</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Hath left the fragrance of her name.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And while we have pointed out the unique attractions of the Scottish
Isles, we have said nothing of the wild, romantic beauty of the Highlands.
The picturesque old ruin of Linlithgow Castle, Bothwell Castle, Loch
Ness, the noble Northern peaks and their surroundings&mdash;all have been
celebrated in glowing prose and verse, and around them clusters history
and romance enough to make many volumes.</p>

<p>It is not easy to sum up the beauties of Scotland within the space of
a few pages. It is a land where Nature and Romance go hand in hand,
Nature affording a background of rare beauty, while Romance invests
it with vital human interest. Picture an ideal tour in which each day is
filled with profit and pleasure, and all Nature’s resources in land, sea, and
sky combine to delight you and draw you on&mdash;then call that tour a
“Summer in Scotland.”</p>
